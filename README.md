<h3> Introduction </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
 <p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rapid development of information technology has now spread into almost every field, including education, daily life, business, health, transportation, and so on. They have improved the ability to exchange knowledge and have accelerated the flow of information and communication. Attending events is something that many people enjoy. And these events are already coping with what technology has to offer now.

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Events play an important role in our society. Any happening or an activity can be referred to as an event. Individuals often find they lack the expertise and time to plan events themselves. Independent planners are needed to step in and give these special events the attention they deserve. In the current scenario, planning an event requires a lot of patience and hustle bustle right from deciding the theme to deciding venue and events. Lots of factors need to be considered while making each decision.

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration, queuing, and manual check-in were just a few of the many tasks that event organizers were required to complete. These procedures are frequently carried out by hand or using traditional methods. However, the days of filling out paper registration forms and mailing checks to events are long gone. It's not only out of date in comparison to more modern, streamlined processes. This issue is easily solved by utilizing modern technology.

<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aventri is an application that supports online registration and feedback evaluation for event training programs such as games, seminars and workshops. It helps program attendees and organizers in their respective activities. Development of an event management application is an attempt to address the problems of managing registration forms, feedback forms and evaluating feedback. The main goal of this application is to give a working solution to store, manage and consolidate the registration data and the feedback data. When using aventri the participants can simply register at their convenience and submit their information immediately. The participant can do corrections as needed without worrying about erasing or cutting. The information the participant sends will be immediately loaded into the database. Organizers donâ€™t have to worry about sorting the information submitted by participants; the database will be updated automatically, and that is a massive advantage in terms of saving time.
